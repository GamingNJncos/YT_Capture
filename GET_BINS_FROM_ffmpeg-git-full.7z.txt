Get the bins from ffmpeg-git-full.7z   @  https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#release-builds

For example copy everything from ffmpeg-8.0.1-full_build.7z\ffmpeg-8.0.1-full_build\bin\ into same dir as .py OR use system path 

=============================================================================
You do not need to install this inside python. It is a system-level tool.

Download: Go to the Gyan.dev FFmpeg builds (the standard source for Windows).

Download the file labeled ffmpeg-git-full.7z.

Extract: Unzip it. You will see a bin folder containing ffmpeg.exe.

Place it: Copy ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe, and ffprobe.exe into the same folder as your archiver.py script.

Alternatively: Add the bin folder to your System PATH if you want it available everywhere, but putting it in the script folder is the easiest "portable" fix.
